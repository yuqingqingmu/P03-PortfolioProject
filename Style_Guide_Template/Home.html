          <h3>About</h3>
            <p>This is the final project for IAT 103 in 2019 which is about holding a feasible campaign for introducing the idea of avoiding plagiarism to first year students. The biggest part for this project is to design a serial of posters to get attention from the target audience and let them take part in our campaign.</p>

          <div><h3>Process</h3>
            <ol class="numberedList">
            <li>Brainstorm: analyzing first year student’s state, what is their need? What is the content on the poster?</li>
            <li>Decide the elements: daily items to present each student, for instance, mobile phone, pencil and coffee cup.</li>
            <li>Digital drafts</li>
            <li>Final Poster</li>
            </ol>
          </div>

          <div><h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>Since we are creating a serial of posters, it is hard to unify the design style when we have five designer in a group. In order to solve the problem, I communicated with my team members to decide what kinds of elements should be included on the poster, and asked everybody to research some related posters. After researching and brainstorming, we all agreed to use the student’s daily item to symbolize individuals, and use bright color palette to create the posters. As the main designer, I was in charge of create the first layout and the illustration, then my teammates could follow the template to make the same style posters.</p>
