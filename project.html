          <h3>About</h3>
            <p>
            This is a project for creating a e-commerce website for a visual interior design company. As a team, we applied a minimalism style to design the website in order to fit the concept of the company. This website contained all the basic information that a company should have, including the update event, company story, product list and contact method. As the designer, we would like to create a clear simple layout website with accessibility in order to let all the users can browser the website easily.

            <ol class="numberedList">
            <li>Brainstorm：decided the company’s concept, target audience and the color palette.</li>
            <li>Styleguide: built up a style guide could help every one in the team could follow the same style to develop the work, and it allows us to update each elements on the website easier.</li>
            <li>Wireframe: since everybody had created own product list page, so we decided to re-design this page by combining all the ideas.</li>
            <li>Final website</li>
            </ol>

          <div><h3>Challenge</h3>
            <p>The biggest challenge is to design a user-friendly website for all the users. Since there are many different devices now, for instance, Ipad, Iphone and PC, our website should work for all of them.  At the first, the layout of web page is not responsive on different devices, for instance, all the text are compressed together; the image is too small; and the navigation bar can not work. In order to solve the problem, we conducted usability test on different devices and fix the problem.</p>
